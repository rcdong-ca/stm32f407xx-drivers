# stm32f407xx-drivers
Drivers for Peripherals on the STM32f407xx MCU

Currently, I have Driver Support for GPIO, UART, I2C and SPI.

Next Goal:
  1. More Dedicated drivers to the onboard sensors such as the MEMs and temperature sensor.
  2. Set up a webserver on the Ethernet port that captures the sensory data and outputs them onto the webserver
